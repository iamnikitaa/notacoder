**notacoder** is a vibe. It's a hands-on, fill-in-the-blank coding playground built with Django, designed for beginners who want to learn Python without the yawn-inducing theory. The goal is to build logic and confidence, one challenge at a time. Slay your first `print()` statement and level up from there.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Heads up:** This project is a major work-in-progress. Things might break, look weird, or randomly change. It's all part of the process. ‚ú®

## The Vibe (Features)

*   **üß† Learn by Doing:** Progressive, fill-in-the-blank challenges that guide you from "Hello, World!" to understanding classes.
*   **üéÆ Gamified Progression:** Earn points for each correct solution and track your completed challenges.
*   **üíÖ Guest Mode:** Hop in and try challenges without an account. Create a "guest user" with just a name and a magic word to save your progress.
*   **‚ú® Confetti Confirmed:** Get that sweet, sweet confetti validation when you get an answer right. Because you deserve it.

## Tech Stack & Setup

This project is built on a simple but powerful stack.

*   **Backend:** Python 3.12, Django 5.1
*   **Database:** SQLite3 (perfect for development and simple hosting)
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, a sprinkle of JavaScript
*   **Frameworks/Libs:** Bootstrap 5 (for layout), Confetti.js (for the vibes)

### Getting it Running Locally

Wanna run this on your own machine? Bet.

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/iamnikitaa-notacoder.git
    cd iamnikitaa-notacoder
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment (you should, for real):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the good stuff:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the migrations to set up your database:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Populate the database with the starter challenges:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py add_challenges
    ```

6.  **Fire up the server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    Now you can open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see the site live.
