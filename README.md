## notacoder üêô

**notacoder** is a chill little coding playground built with Django. It‚Äôs for beginners who want to learn Python without sitting through hours of theory videos or pretending to understand what recursion is on day one.

You get bite-sized challenges where you fill in the blanks, hit submit, and maybe celebrate with some confetti. It‚Äôs simple, low-stress, and kind of fun (once the code runs).

**Disclaimer:** This project is under construction. Things might look odd, break randomly, or disappear. That‚Äôs life. We move.

## Features

- **Learn by Doing:** Skip the 50-slide intro. Just open a challenge and start typing.
- **Points & Progress:** Get points for solving stuff. Feels good.
- **Guest Mode:** No sign-ups, no emails, no passwords. Just jump in.
- **Confetti? Yes:** Correct answers get sparkles. Because why not.
